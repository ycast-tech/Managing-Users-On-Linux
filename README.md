# Managing Users On Linux

Previously I made a <a href="https://github.com/ycast-tech/Managing-Linux-File-Permissions">project</a> focused on authorization, the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. Another important concept in security is authentication. Authentication is the process of a user proving that they are who they say they are in the system.

When managing this, security analysts need to ensure: 
- not all users get access to the system,
- new users (those who are new to the organization or a group) are added to the system, and
- current users who change groups or leave the organization are deleted from the system.<br>
In this project, Iâ€™ll use the focus in this topics by adding, managing, and deleting users from an organization.


In Linux Bash shell, the commands <code>useradd</code>, <code>usermod</code>, <code>userdel</code>, and <code>chown</code> can be used to manage user access.

In this scenario, a new employee with the username <code>researcher9</code> joins an organization. I have to add them to the system and continue to manage their access during their time with the organization.

## Add a new user

A new employee has joined the Research department. In this task, I must add them to the system. The username assigned to them is <code>researcher9</code>.

To add a user to the system I must use <code>useradd</code> command.

Next, I need to add the new user to the <code>research_team</code> group.<br>
I need to use the <code>usermod</code> command and <code>-g</code> option to add <code>researcher9</code> to the <code>research_team</code> group as their primary group.

<b>Note:</b> The commands used need elevated permissions, for that, the <code>sudo</code> command is used.

<b>Step 1:</b> run <code>sudo useradd researcher9</code><br>
<b>Step 2:</b> run <code>sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9</code>

## Assign file ownership

The new employee, researcher9, will take responsibility for <code>project_r</code>. The project_r.txt file is located in the <code>/home/researcher2/projects</code> directory, and owned by the researcher2 user. I need to make researcher9 the owner of /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt

To change ownership, I need to run <code>chown</code> command followed by the new owner and the location of the file.<br>
<code>sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt</code>

To check if it was done correctly run <code>ls -l</code> to display information about the file such as ownership

## Add the user to a secondary group



## Delete a user



## Summary

In this project I show my experience managing users on Linux by adding and removing users to to the system and groups.
